## 🔧 Technical Details

### Authentication Flow
1. User fills out login/signup form
2. Form validation on frontend
3. API call to backend `/auth/login` or `/auth/register`
4. JWT token received and stored in localStorage
5. User object stored in AuthContext
6. Automatic redirect to home page
7. Header shows user menu when authenticated

### API Endpoints Working
- ✅ POST `/api/auth/register` - User registration
- ✅ POST `/api/auth/login` - User login
- ✅ GET `/api/auth/me` - Get current user (protected)
- ✅ POST `/api/auth/logout` - User logout

### Data Models Aligned
- ✅ User model with all required fields (name, email, role, etc.)
- ✅ Photo model with submission workflow and moderation
- ✅ Review model with ratings and approval system
- ✅ Comment model with threading and moderation

## 🧪 Testing

### Backend API Tests (All Passing ✅)
```bash
# Registration Test
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Test User", "email": "test@example.com", "password": "Test123456"}'

# Login Test  
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "Test123456"}'

# Protected Route Test
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/auth/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [JWT_TOKEN]"
```

### Frontend Pages Available
- ✅ http://localhost:3001 - Home page with updated header
- ✅ http://localhost:3001/login - Login page with AuthContext integration
